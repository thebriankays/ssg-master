# Component System Overview

The SSG component system provides a comprehensive set of React components built with modern web technologies, focusing on performance, accessibility, and developer experience.

## Architecture

Our component library is organized into five main categories:

### 1. Core Components
Fundamental building blocks that handle essential functionality like images and links.

### 2. Animation Components
Components that bring motion and interactivity to your interfaces with smooth, performant animations.

### 3. Layout Components
Structural components that help organize and present content in flexible, responsive ways.

### 4. WebGL Components
High-performance graphics components leveraging WebGL for stunning visual effects.

### 5. Typography Components
Text-based components that ensure consistent, accessible typography across your application.

## Design Principles

### Performance First
- Lazy loading and code splitting by default
- Optimized rendering with React.memo where appropriate
- WebGL acceleration for complex visual effects

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly implementations

### Developer Experience
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Consistent prop interfaces across components
- Comprehensive documentation with examples

## Getting Started

```tsx
import { Image, Link } from '@/components/core'
import { SplitText, Marquee } from '@/components/animation'
import { Accordion, Fold } from '@/components/layout'
```

## Common Patterns

### Composition
Components are designed to work together seamlessly:

```tsx
<Fold>
  <SplitText>
    <Heading>Welcome to SSG</Heading>
  </SplitText>
  <Image src="/hero.jpg" alt="Hero image" />
</Fold>
```

### Styling
All components support className props and work with Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
<Link 
  href="/about" 
  className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"
>
  Learn More
</Link>
```

### Animation Control
Animation components provide fine-grained control:

```tsx
<SplitText
  delay={0.1}
  duration={0.8}
  ease="power2.out"
>
  Animated text content
</SplitText>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Import only what you need**: Use specific imports to keep bundle sizes small
2. **Leverage TypeScript**: Take advantage of type hints for better development experience
3. **Consider performance**: Use WebGL components for complex visuals, standard components for simple UI
4. **Accessibility first**: Always provide alt text, ARIA labels, and keyboard support
5. **Responsive design**: All components are mobile-first and responsive by default

## Component Categories

- [Core Components](./core.md) - Essential building blocks
- [Animation Components](./animation.md) - Motion and interactivity
- [Layout Components](./layout.md) - Structure and organization
- [WebGL Components](./webgl.md) - High-performance graphics
- [Typography Components](./typography.md) - Text and headings

## Contributing

When creating new components, follow these guidelines:

1. Extend from base interfaces when appropriate
2. Include TypeScript definitions
3. Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
4. Provide usage examples
5. Test accessibility features
6. Document any performance considerations
